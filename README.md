# fakeNewsClassifier-LSTM-
Implemented a fake news classifier with LSTM. 

•	Implemented text preprocessing pipeline (eg: removing stopwords, stemming, one hot representation, padding sequence, word embedding representation) 
•	Performed feature selection, chosen relevant column for fake news indicator. 
•	Built the binary classification LSTM model. 
•	Extra works: compared performances with other feature representations, eg: CountVectorizer (bag-of-words), TfidfVectorizer, with ML algorithms eg: MultinomialNB, Passive Aggressive Classifier.
